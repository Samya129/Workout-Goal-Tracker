## Description

As a full-stack developer, one might be tasked to connect the front-end development with the back-end code they have created. In this application, we want to create a database (Mongo), a schema (Mongoose), as well as handle routes with Express to effectively and efficiently produce a well-working application with front-end. For consumers, they will be able reach their fitness goals faster when they track their workout progress.
